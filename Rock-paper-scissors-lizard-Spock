# Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock

""" 
This program is based on the following:

Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
Scissors decapitates Lizard
Lizard eats Paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes Rock
(and as it always has) Rock crushes scissors

# 0 - rock
# 1 - Spock
# 2 - paper
# 3 - lizard
# 4 - scissors
